Thursday, March 22, 2012: up to Hello in the in-class examples. Memorize the following incantation. “The init method of the subclass always begins by calling the init method of the superclass. The dealloc method of the subclass always ends by calling the dealloc method of the superclass.” Run the projects and do the exercises for class Date, class Person, and Hello, but don’t hand them in. Create a project on your Desktop named March29 (not March29th or March-29) that prints or draws something on the iPhone (or iPad) screen, and upload it to a GitHub repository named March29.
Click on the tip of each nose in the class photo. Please let me know if I got the names mixed up. If you’re not in the photo, you can Photoshop yourself in and mail it to me. On March 29, try to open the window in the classroom. I still have no GitHib account names for Christopher Budetti, Deepali Kaushik, Joonho Lee, and Julia Nelson-Abbott.
